# Demolitions

This is a python notebook with some of the data I used for a class paper on land use. This examines abandonment in Detroit and analyzes some of the determinants of where demolition is occurring today.

Data for the notebook is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-XAvgsUnUu0Tn4P4nBhGpigK17Lsd6vV?usp=sharing
